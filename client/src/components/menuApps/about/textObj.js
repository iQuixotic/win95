        projectName: 'This Project',
        q1: `This project turned out bigger, better, and more beautiful that I could have ever hoped for. I 
        was heavily inspired by Windows 95 if that wasn't obvious. I wanted to use a mix 
        of fonts and colors to put my own spin on a 'classic' look. I feel that my style really shines
        through on this project. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed making it!!`,
        q2: `There are links everywhere!! If you are absolutely lost, or unsure why I did something, check out the 
        'help' page from the start menu to gain a little clarity. Enjoy!`,

    catClicker: {
        projectName: 'Cat Clicker',
        q1: `This was the first really cool thing I made when I was learning Javascript. Although its super 
        simple, I just loved it so much that I had to include it.`,
        q2: `Random numbers are generated for each cat picture. A target number is generated. Click 
        the cats to raise the current number to the target number.`,

    portfolio: {
        projectName: 'Personal Portfolio',
        q1: `This was my first Portfolio and I was super excited about it! It was the first time I bought 
        a custom domain, and I hosted it on an Amazon EC2 instance. I also used jQuery and Materialize. 
        I was really happy with how clean and readable the code turned out. It was also quite colorful (and 
        I do love my oversaturated bright colors).`,
        q2: `You can navigate to other projects I have posted. The carousel spins and changes the bottom 
        paragraph text and header text with Javascript. There are links everywhere!! `,

    lilLibs: {
        projectName: 'Lil Libs',
        q1: `I worked on this project with a team and I really learned a lot because of it. This was a really 
        involved application and it took 4 people 6 days to make it. I feel accomplished to have been 
        one of those four. :)`,

    },
    avatarCards: {
        projectName: 'Avatar Cards',
        q1: `This was the very first project I built using React. Its beauty is in its simplicity. This was also 
        one of the first projects that I fell in love with. It's a cool app and I was all around happy with it. 
        Also, I made it fully mobile responsive and it looks great on a phone.`,
        q2: `Click the cards one at the time. Try to click each one once. If you perform 12 clicks without ever clicking 
        the same card twice, you will be rewarded with a fancy Gif.`,

    picturePuzzles: {
        projectName: 'Picture Puzzles',
        q1: `This was really special to me because of the concept. I wanted to be able to 
        take a picture, break it apart, and move the pieces around to put 
        it back together. It was one of the first ideas I had when I started 
        teaching myself to code, but at the time, I was unsure how I would even 
        begin something like this. The idea of being able to drag and drop something to 
        another part of the screen, was initially incomprehensible, yet here I am.`,
        q2: `Select a puzzle to complete. Move each of the 16 pieces independantly by dragging
        and dropping. If you want to see a reference picture, click the button at the 
        bottom. Once you are done, click the 'How did I do?' button to find out your 
        score.`,

    zenith: {
        projectName: 'Zenith Holdings',
        q1: `This is the first project I built using Typescript! Don't be fooled by the 
        simplistic look! When I made this, I wanted to focus heavily on the logic and 
        it shows. The speed of this app is incredible considering you're working with 
        persistent data. Numbers are converted to strings complete with commas and dollar strings 
        via a custom function.`,
        q2: `You can add or subtract money from an account, check out previous transactions,
        or create your own account. Data is persistent. Feel free to give it a shot!`,
