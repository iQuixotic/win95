        a: `Email: treyw1850@gmail.com`,  a2: `Phone: (334) 342-8086`,
        b: `Yes. All panels are draggable and can be grabbed
        at the blue area and dropped anywhere on screen.`,
        c: `Resizing of this content is not allowed. This was a design choice. 
        I wanted to focus on getting the style to look really nice inside a window so as not to hide all 
        the hard work I put in on the desktop splash background.`,
        d: `Either use the SQUARE expansion button OR 
        click and drag panels along the left and top sides (only portfolio items).`,
        e: `Navigate from Start > Projects > (Pick One) `,
        f: `Yes. Double click them to open. The Internet icon contains a mini app
        that allows you to type in a search term and 20 gifs will be displayed. The Computer contains 
        a way to change the background. Files provides you with contact links.`,
        g: `Windows 95, while not as performant as 
        more recent OS, is objectively more aesthetically pleasing than any operating 
        system before or since.`,
        h: `Whenever I was first learning javascript and css,
        my peers once told me that the style reminded them of the 90s... At some point, 
        this website was destined to be.`,
        i: `Orange, Lime Green, and my favorite Deep Purple.`,
        j: `Not yet. Version 2 will be released shortly, 
        which will include mobile responsivity.`,
        k: `Partly design. Partly ambition. For now, you will
        recieve some screen that lets you know that the feature has not been implemented yet.`,
        l: `Although inspired by Windows 95, this is not an operating system 
        and I didn't feel like it needed to be. The features I included really were what I felt at 
        the time were the core features I wanted to have. Simply put, I make it the way I thought 
        was cool.`
